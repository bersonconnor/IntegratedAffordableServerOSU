These are the SQL files that were modified within the AffordableServerOSU project by the Gettysburg Affordable team.

- CreateDatabase.sql is a modified file from the original SQL file that includes the create database statements for the files, permissions, and encryptions tables.
- All other files are new and contain the SQL stored procedures.
- These files can be added to the /database directory within the AffordableServerOSU project.
