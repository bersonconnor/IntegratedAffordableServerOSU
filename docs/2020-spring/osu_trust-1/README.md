# A Bad Elf Fro (OSU Spring 2020 team) documentation

## Artifacts
- This folder contains artifacts explaining design/implementation concepts for features worked on by our team, they include:
- Admin User functionality                                      
- Authentication/Authorization          
- Verified Email functionality
- Text file with links to mock data schemas

## Insomnia Configuration
We've created a configuration for utilizing [Insomnia](insomnia.rest), an open source REST client that you can use to make requests to the backend, which can be especially helpful for testing/debugging purposes.

This file can be imported into Insomnia by opening the app and clicking "Import/Export" in the app menu. Click "Import Data" and select the Insomnia JSON file in this directory. Note: the requests in this Insomnia configuration only include a subset of Affordable's current functionality, and we suggest adding to this configuration and sharing your changes for future use.

## Other Docs and "README"s outside this folder that we wrote include:
- [server](../../server/NewDeveloperGuide.md)
- [app](../../app/COVID_19_CHANGES_README.md)
- [admin_examples](../../client/src/admin_examples)

## We have also made adjustments along the way to the READMEs in the app and server folders:
- [server](../../server/README.md)
- [app](../../app/README.md)
